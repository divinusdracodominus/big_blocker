# Purpose
This is designed to illustrate the fundemental nature of the tool we have all come to relay on so heavily, principally the internet. While originally intended to be a desenteralizeed means of communication the internet has become anything but that. I'm sure most people reading this know about he cliche of the large tech companies, but the purpose of this is to illustrate the degree of their size, and scope.

## How to install
first install cargo by going to [rust install](https://https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
note this tool is destributed in source format because to do otherwise would make me a hypocrit
once installed navigate to the source code of this repository and run cargo run --release
then run ./target/release/cross-block --block amazon google etc (this must be done as an administrator)

## Future To Dos
use RADb and route-views as well as whois or RDAP to query information about given IP addresses and address ranges
